## Understanding file names
### Default naming convention
Using the "jobs" feature of the Nikon NIS software, the microscope takes a set number of images per well and stores the images as TIFF files in folders named using the R_C_S format where R and C are the row and the column index in the 96-well plate, respectively, and S is the index of sites. This is followed by the channel name or abbreviation (i.e.: 2_3_1_CFP.tiff). You will see this format in most of the data, and the code has been configured for this naming format.

## Navigating the code repository 
MATLAB image analysis code used for image processing and analysis throughout our study is provided here. Certain script and function packages are used multiple times throughout the paper and have their own unique folders, whereas panel-specific scripts are found in the folder 'figure panel specific scripts and instructions'.  Additional instructions for analysis related to specific figure panels can be found in the README files in 'figure panel specific scripts and instructions'. 

### FRET, cell edge velocity tracking, and window analysis 
The ratiometric FRET, cell edge velocity tracking, and window analysis code uses functions written by Sean Collins, as described in:

This code also uses: 
> ANN:Approximate Nearest Neighbours Version 1.1.2. Copyright (c) 1997-2010 University of Maryland and Sunil Arya and David Mount. http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/

### Quantitative immunofluorescence 
The quantitative immunofluorescence code uses functions written by Mingyu Chung, as described in:

### Violin plots 
Violin plots for data visualization were created in part with thanks to:
> Bechtold, Bastian, 2016. Violin Plots for Matlab, Github Project  
> https://github.com/bastibe/Violinplot-Matlab, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.455984

### MATLAB toolboxes 
Running this code requires the following MATLAB toolboxes: curve fitting, image processing, statistics and machine learning, as well as [Statistical Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12333-statistical-learning-toolbox?s_tid=FX_rc2_behav) by Dahua Lin.
