# Excitable Rho dynamics control cell shape and motility by sequentially activating ERM proteins and actomyosin contractility
## Fig. 7. SLK/LOK-dependent ERM activation regulates cell morphology and is required for Rho-driven cell contractions

Panels F7F and F7G were generated by visual inspection of preprocessed images and manual counting of the number of cells and the fraction of cells blebbing in each field of view. The results were manually input into an excel file (`AllDates-BlebbingCount.xlsx`) which was then loaded for figure generation in MATLAB.
